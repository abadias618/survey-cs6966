I think formatting like task 1 would help ""Explanation: [then list explanation] Question: Does the explanation effectively explain why the label classification was assigned? [good, somewhat good, somewhat bad, bad]"" You may also want to specify some examples in the instructions like ""Just because the model says something correct about the image doesn't mean that it is reporting an explanation for why the image classification was assigned. For example, [using the example I saw] ""reporting that the image is of an airplane because an airplane is a vehicle that flies in the sky"" would not be a good explanation because it doesn't reference any features in the image."" Or if I'm reading too much into the instructions and that is a good explanation, different clarification and examples of good and bad explanation would be helpful."
